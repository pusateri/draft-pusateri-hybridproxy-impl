     <t>This document provides advice on the implementation of a DNS Service Discovery Hybrid Proxy Server. It describes the configuration parameters at the delegating DNS server, the hybrid proxy itself, and the client. It also describes the resource records required of the delegating DNS server and the hybrid proxy.</t>

   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>A hybrid proxy <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnssd-hybrid"/> dynamically maps between the multicast DNS link-local infrastructure and the wide-area unicast DNS infrastructure. Externally, it looks like a standard unicast DNS server. Internally, instead of static resource records, it builds a cache of resource records that it learns dynamically on an interface where mDNS is used. These resource records are mapped to a location in the unicast DNS hierarchy by associating a subdomain with each IP subnet.</t>
     <t>Responses to queries made for resource records in the subdomain are filled by a dynamic cache of records learned dynamically from the IP subnet. Unicast queries received by the hybrid proxy may trigger mDNS queries from the hybrid proxy to the IP subnet associated with the subdomain. If subscriptions are active for the record in a query, the hybrid proxy will already have an up to date cache and no mDNS queries are triggered.</t> 
   </section>
   <section title="Delegating DNS Server">

   <section title="Hybrid Proxy Configuration">

     <section title="@hybrid_proxy.subdomain">
       <t>This configuration item is for each IP subnet.</t>

       <t>The hybrid proxy must determine which subdomain name to associate with each connected IP subnet. If multiple hybrid proxies exist on the same IP subnet, this subdomain name should be consistent across all hybrid proxies on that IP subnet.</t>

       <t>There are several different ways that a hybrid proxy can determine the subdomain name of it's connected IP subnets.</t>
       <t>
         <list style="numbers">
           <t>The subdomain name can be configured manually or distributed by an out of band method.</t>
           <t>The hybrid proxy can query legacy browse domain PTR records for the network portion of the interface address as described in Section 11 of <xref target="RFC6763"/>. Suppose an interface on the hybrid proxy is configured with IP address 192.0.2.1/24. The network portion is 192.0.2.0/24. A query is made for lb._dns-sd._udp.0.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa. For IPv6, the extension for PTR address queries is ip6.arpa. All hybrid proxies on the IP subnet will make the same query since the network portion is the same for all of them. The returned name will be &lt;subdomain&gt;.&lt;zone&gt;, where &lt;zone&gt; is the delegating zone. As an example, this could be foo.example.com where example.com is the domain name distributed through DHCP or IPv6 Router Advertisement Options <xref target="RFC6106">RFC&nbsp;6106</xref> and foo is the assigned subdomain. If the hybrid proxy does not know the base domain name or know which domain name from a list of search domains to respond to, the domain name returned from this query can be used as a indicator. The left most label is the subdomain and the remainder is the base domain name or zone. This domain name could be different on each connected IP subnet of a particular hybrid proxy, especially in a multi-tenant environment.</t>
           <t>The hybrid proxy can use a naming algorithm where each proxy will arrive at the same value using the supplied algorithm. The hybrid proxy will have to learn the zone through another means such as DHCP or SLAAC. No particular algorithm should be mandated but an example of such an algorithm would be to create a hexadecimal string based on the network portion of the interface IP address. For the example above with interface IP address 192.0.2.1/24, the hexadecimal string of the network portion would be C0000200. This string could be prefixed with ASCII characters if desired resulting in a subdomain of netc0000200.example.com. All hybrid proxies with an interface on the same subnet can independently compute the same subdomain name. This might be challenging in a multi-vendor environment.</t>
         </list>
       </t>
     </section>
     <section title="@hybrid_proxy.ns_delegation_name">
       <t>This configuration item is for each IP subnet.</t>
     
       <t>In order for the hybrid to function as an authoritative server for a subdomain, the subdomain must be delegated by the DNS server responsible for the zone it is delegated from.</t>

       <t>The hybrid proxy must know the NS record delegation name and the address for which to listen for queries that are forwarded. Before the delegation server will forward queries to the delegated hybrid proxy for a subdomain, it will query the NS record for the subdomain from the hybrid proxy to ensure it will accept queries for the subdomain.</t>

       <t>In the case of multiple hybrid proxies, the delegating server will have multiple NS record delegations and will select one based on local policy to forward requests to.</t>
     </section>
     <section title="@hybrid_proxy.ns_delegation_name_address_records">
       <t>This configuration item is for each @hybrid_proxy.ns_delegation_name</t>
       <t>The address records must refer to active addresses (IPv4 or IPv6) on the hybrid proxy.</t>
     </section>
     <section title="Hybrid Proxy Records">
       <t>The hybrid proxy must answer the following resource records when queried:</t>
       <t>
         <list style="numbers">
           <t>SOA record - SOA for &lt;subdomain&gt;.&lt;zone&gt; with MNAME the same as the NS delegation name.</t>
           <t>Browse domain record - PTR b._dns-sd._udp.&lt;subdomain&gt;.&lt;zone&gt; with NAME pointing to the fully qualified &lt;subdomain&gt;.&lt;zone&gt;.</t>
           <t>Legacy browse domain record - PTR lb._dns-sd._udp.&lt;subdomain&gt;.&lt;zone&gt; with NAME pointing to the fully qualified &lt;subdomain&gt;.&lt;zone&gt;.</t>
         </list>
       </t>
       <t>Additionally, if <xref target="I-D.sekar-dns-llq">LLQ</xref> and/or <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnssd-push">DNS Push</xref> is supported, the hybrid proxy must answer to these additional records:</t>
       <t>
         <list style="numbers">
           <t>LLQ over UDP - SRV _dns-llq._udp.&lt;subdomain&gt;.&lt;zone&gt; with target as NS delegation name</t>
           <t>LLQ over TCP - SRV _dns-llq._tcp.&lt;subdomain&gt;.&lt;zone&gt; with target as NS delegation name</t>
           <t>DNS Push - SRV _dns-push._tcp.&lt;subdomain&gt;.&lt;zone&gt; with target as NS delegation name</t>
         </list>
       </t>
       <t>Since there may be multiple LLQ and/or DNS Push SRV records for each subdomain (one for each hybrid proxy), each hybrid proxy should return all of the SRV records from each hybrid proxy on the IP subnet. Otherwise only a subset of SRV records may be cached and load balancing may not be effective.</t>

       <t>In order for each hybrid proxy to learn about the other hybrid proxy's SRV records, each hybrid proxy should advertise its own SRV records for LLQ and/or DNS Push through mDNS on the shared IP subnet.</t>

       <t>Because there should only be one SOA record for the delegated subdomain, a mechanism is needed to ensure only one hybrid proxy advertises the SOA record for the delegated subdomain. (TBD)</t>
     </section>
     <section title="Hybrid Proxy Optional Configuration Parameters">
       <t>The above parameters satisfy the minimum configuration requirements but it is likely that additional parameters will be desired. Examples include the port numbers to listen for mandatory TLS or policy to determine which services get advertised to which unicast clients.</t>

       <section title="@hybrid_proxy.udp_llq_port">
         <t>Port 53, 5352, or custom, advertised in SRV record</t>
       </section>

The hybrid proxy may choose to not listen for queries until these records are present.</t>
